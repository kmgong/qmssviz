###**A**###

The survey I will be examining is the World Values Survey. Specifically, we'll be looking at the willingness of survey respondents to have homosexual neighbours in Wave 3 (1995-1998) and Wave 6 (2010-2014). The question appears on Card G in both waves and is labeled Question V60 in Wave 3 and V40 in Wave 6. There is a very slight different in working between the two waves, though we are not primarily concerned with the difference in wording.

Wave 3:



```{r}
load("~/qmssviz/hw3/WV3.RData")
WV3 = WV3_Data_rdata_v_2014_09_21
load("~/qmssviz/hw3/WV6.RData")
WV6 = WV6_Data_spss_v_2014_06_04
head(WV6)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
