This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
=======
title: "Homework 3 - Kevin Gong"
output: html_document
date: "October 23, 2014"
published: false

###**A**###

The survey I will be examining is the World Values Survey. Specifically, we'll be looking at 

```{r}
load("~/qmssviz/hw3/WV3.RData")
WV3 = WV3_Data_rdata_v_2014_09_21
load("~/qmssviz/hw3/WV6.RData")
WV6 = WV6_Data_rdata_v_2014_09_21

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
